
Platformer with a twist

4/10/2016

Hypothesis: To create a puzzle platformer with verticality.

Process and Reflection

Since it was a short 2 hour development time, the time to come up with different ideas was very limited. Being inspired by monument valley, I decided to use an orthographic camera for my game. I wanted to make this a game that revolved around interesting level design and very simple mechanics. I ended up building an orthographic camera, putting a player block on it and adding some controls to it. The rest of the game seemed to follow what I originally had. Since I was going for a vertical design, I made lots of tall buildings and it ended up looking like a city. I needed different ways to climb up the level since I did not want to add jumping to my game. To address that I made sloping blocks and moving platforms. I was very happy with what I ended up with after a mere 2 hours of work. I had a fairly polished game in terms of working mechanics and it looked presentable.


Conclusion
My game was liked and well received. The level design was interesting and the moving platforms added a sense of grandeur to the game. The mechanics are simple to understand for the player. Additionally building the levels was not very hard and would work very well for a short game play experience. I am very happy with what I ended up with.
